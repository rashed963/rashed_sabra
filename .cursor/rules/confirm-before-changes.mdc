# Confirm before changes

- **Do not** edit files, create/delete files, or run terminal commands without the user's explicit confirmation first.
- **Propose** changes (e.g. show diff, describe new file, or state the command) and wait for the user to approve before applying.
- Exception: reading files, searching code, or listing directories to answer questions does not require confirmation.
