# Knowledge base context

When working in this repo, **read and follow** the private knowledge base so suggestions match project goals and the author's background.

## Files to use (do not commit; they are gitignored)

- **`knowledge-base/project-goal.md`** — Vision, audience, publishing model, technical approach, priorities, tone, and out-of-scope.
- **`knowledge-base/personal-background.md`** — Author’s role, focus areas, writing themes, preferences, and constraints.

## How to use them

1. At the start of a task that affects content, structure, or workflow, read the relevant file(s).
2. Align recommendations with: blog-first publishing, minimal/readable UI, Astro + Content Collections, and the stated priorities.
3. Respect tone (minimal, clear, practical) and out-of-scope items (no DB/CMS, no heavy extras this quarter).
